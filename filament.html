        </div>
        <p>
            Filament is the material used in 3D printing to create objects. It comes in various types, each with unique properties and uses.
            Common types include PLA, ABS, PETG, and TPU. Understanding the characteristics of each filament type is crucial for successful 3D printing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like an HTML page, filaments can come in a variety of colors, gradients, and finishes.
             Some filaments are even infused with materials like wood, metal, or glow-in-the-dark particles to achieve special effects. 
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZackFreedman" rel="nofollow">Zack Freedman</a> has a series of videos exploring the many types
             of filaments available, the first of which is linked below.

                <th>PLA</th>
                <td>PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a biodegradable plastic made from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane. 
                    It's easy to print with and is ideal for beginners.</td>
                <td>PLA is not as heat-resistant as other filaments and can become brittle over time,
                     especially when exposed to the outdoor elements.</td>

            <tr>
                <th>ABS</th>
                <td>ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a strong plastic that can withstand higher temperatures, 
                    making it suitable for functional parts. </td>
                <td>ABS can warp during printing and requires a heated bed. It also emits fumes that are potentially harmful,
                    so proper ventilation is necessary.</td>

                <th>PETG</th>

                <td>PETG can be more challenging to print than PLA and may require adjustments to print settings.</td>

                <td>These filaments may require longer exposure to light to achieve a strong glow and can be more brittle than standard filaments.</td>
