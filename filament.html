        <p>
            Filament is the material used in 3D printing to create objects. It comes in various types, each with unique properties and uses.
            Common types include PLA, ABS, PETG, and TPU. Understanding the characteristics of each filament type is crucial for successful 3D printing.

                <td>PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a biodegradable plastic made from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane. 
                    It's easy to print with and is ideal for beginners.</td>
                <td>PLA is not as heat-resistant as other filaments and can become brittle over time,
                     especially when exposed to the outdoor elements.</td>

            <tr>
                <th>ABS</th>
                <td>ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a strong plastic that can withstand higher temperatures, 
                    making it suitable for functional parts. </td>
                <td>ABS can warp during printing and requires a heated bed. It also emits fumes that are potentially harmful,
                    so proper ventilation is necessary.</td>

                <th>PETG</th>
                <td>PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) combines the ease of PLA with the strength of ABS, making it a versatile choice.</td>
                <td>PETG can be more challenging to print than PLA and may require adjustments to print settings.</td>

                <th>TPU</th>
                <td>TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) is a flexible filament used for creating rubber-like objects.</td>
                <td>TPU can be difficult to print due to its flexibility, requiring a well-calibrated printer and specific settings.</td>
